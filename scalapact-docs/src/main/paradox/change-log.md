## 2.2.0 - 2017-10-05
**Breaking changes.**

With thanks to [yasuba] and [itsDanOades] for assisting with this release.

Highlights:

- Accepts basic auth for Pact Broker addresses ([phil-rice])
- Output dir (target/pacts) is now configurable via SBT config and environment variable "pact.rootDir" ([fergusstrange])
- Publish to multiple provider pact brokers
- **[BREAKING]** Matching logic completely rewritten (this could break existing tests in one or two cases, but once fixed they will be correct by the Pact Specification)
- **[BREAKING]** No more dependency conflicts
    - No external lib dependancies in any of the core libraries.
    - You must tell Scala-Pact which Http and JSON libraries to use (see setup guide).
    - JSON support via either Argonaut 6.1, Argonaut 6.2, or Circe 0.8.0
    - HTTP support via Http4s versions 0.15.0a, 0.16.2, 0.16.2a, or 0.17.0
    - Example projects use a range of Scala and lib combinations to prove they work (to be expanded)
- **[BREAKING]** Renamed sbt plugin to sbt-scalapact
- Composable SBT Tasks (pactPack, packPush, pactStub, and pactCheck)
- Scala-Pact env config (e.g. port and local dir) is now defined in the build sbt file.
  - Commands inherit and can override via the usual command line arguments.

Bug fixes:

- Scala-Pact can now be used reliably inside SBT to avoid constantly starting SBT from cold.
- Issues with matching rules and how they deal with deep or multiple layers of wildcards have been resolved.
- Regex matching of values no longer expects an exact match, instead expects to find at least one match.

Other improvements for contributors:

- Converted to multi-project build
- Many more modules, improved separation of concerns
  - Extending support for alternate HTTP and JSON frameworks is now easy.
- Better build / test scripts include testing cross compilation
- Simpler project version management
- Release script improvements

## 2.1.3 - 2017-03-24
- Convert SBT plugin to AutoPlugin ([yasuba])
- Ability to set a client timeout on verification ([itsDanOades])
- XML matching rules now work as expected
- Pact match failures against the stubber now return a 598 status, NOT a misleading 404.
- BUGFIX: Pact stubber now accepts chunked requests
- BUGFIX: Pact broker addresses can now include a port number
- BUGFIX: Bad test case fixed that would previously always succeed ([yasuba])

## 2.1.2 - 2017-01-25
- BUGFIX: Small issue that slipped through testing: In order for providerStates to work you had to declare a providerStateMatcher somewhere even if you already have a normal providerState setting. This has been resolved.

## 2.1.1 - 2017-01-24
- Accept `provider_state` on Pact file read to support old Pact formats ([itsDanOades])
- Added new `providerStateMatcher` partial function as a slicker, more useful alternative to the old mechanism. ([jtsmith0107])

## 2.1.0 - 2016-12-16
- Scala 2.12 release
    - Depends on http4s 0.15.0a which is bundled with argonaut 6.2-RC1 and scalaz 7.2.7
- Fixed intermittent bug that failed otherwise good tests
- Improved test speed
- Fixed issue where having a large number of pact tests in one suite caused a failure (with thanks to [BenParker22])
- Increased performance / capacity of pact stubber
- Provider state failures now fail noisily
- runConsumerTest returns a result instead of Unit ([agustafson])

## 2.0.0 - 2016-11-01
- Full Pact Specification Version 2.0 Compliance
- Body matching rules
- Provider verification test framework
- Strict mode
- Reduced library dependencies
- Improved mock config object
- Handle lowercase method during verify ([smithleej])

## 1.0.2 - 2016-10-04
- Remove logging implementation dependencies ([agustafson])
- Added example projects
- Scala-PactContractWriter creates directories 'target' and 'pacts' if they don't exist ([raoulk])
- Add preflight request operation (OPTIONS) ([itsDanOades])
- Codified testing process in a shell script.

## 1.0.1 - 2016-07-19
- Verifier does not post data if body is empty
- Added the ability to specify a pact version when verifying ([itsDanOades])

## 1.0.0 - 2016-05-26
- Initial public release following a number of in house only dev and milestone versions. ([davesmith00000], [Iulian-Antohe], [smithleej], [blake-boesinger])
