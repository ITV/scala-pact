# Get help
Depending on the kind of help or support you need, there are a few places you can try:

## Feature requests and bug reports
Have a look around our [issues page](https://github.com/ITV/scala-pact/issues) to see if anyone else has raised a similar request. If not, please raise a new issue and we'll try and help.

If you're a developer and you're feeling brave and generous, feel free to submit a pull request and we'll always do our best to accept it. For more information, please read our [contributing](https://github.com/ITV/scala-pact/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Information on Pact or CDC
Good places to start are the official [pact.io](http://www.pact.io) website or this article on [CDC](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html).

## Help using Scala-Pact or Pact
Please direct questions to the [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pact) page or the official [Pact support google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pact-support). As well as queries, we would love to hear feedback about your experiences with Scala-Pact and Pact generally.

If you're a developer looking to contribute or build a new Pact implementation there's a [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pact-dev) for that too!
